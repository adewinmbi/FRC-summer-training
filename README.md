# FRC-summer-training
Programming assignment for FRC 687



### Important Changes

* Imported the frc package from [InfiniteRecharge2021](https://github.com/nerdherd/InfiniteRecharge2021) in order to:
  * Import the Drive and DriveConstants classes which were not available in the original submodule
  * Add auto commands in the correct directory 

* Created RunMotor.java as the auto to be run by the button (just drives forward)
* Defined the autochooser and added option in Robot.java
* Called SmartDashboard.putData() in OI.java
* Removed classes that weren't necessary for this assignment from the frc package
